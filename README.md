# AI skolprov

On this page, you can see how some of the most advanced AI models (specifically language models or LLMs) perform on the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test. Development is progressing rapidly, and it can be challenging to assess how well these new tools can solve various tasks. Having the models take tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test provides a concrete way to measure their capabilities. It is a tool that developers, researchers, and companies can use to evaluate what the models can be used for.
